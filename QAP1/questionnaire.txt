1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 
    (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - 
    an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

    - It took me about 2 - 3 hours to complete this.

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

    - I mostly used your lectures and the previous practice we did. I did use Google for some things I was stuck on.

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. 
    (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

    - No, I did not need to ask any of my friends for help

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask 
    (or how many help sessions did you require)?

    - No, I did not need to ask my intructors for any help. The practice and lectures was plenty help.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that 
    you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

    - I didn't find these questions very hard. Java is gonna take some practice, but once you get the hang of it
      it can come along fairly easy.
